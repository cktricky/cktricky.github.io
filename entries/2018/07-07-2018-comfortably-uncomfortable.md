# Comfortably Uncomfortable

Whew, it has been a crazy year. I've not written nearly as often in this journal as I'd originally hoped for but the good news is I've been doing a lot of other "things".

The point of this entry is centered around those "things". One of the little life lessons I've learned along the way in my journey is that it is good to be uncomfortable.

This isn't super revolutionary and I believe is fairly well known. What can I do is list/share how this has helped me for personal growth and fulfillment. Now let's list this year in a nutshell:

* Competed in my first BJJ tournament
* Spoke in Brazil to mixed english and non-english speaking crowd
* Dove head first into a new programming language (Golang)
* Started a podcast and completed roughly 22 episodes of that podcast (and still going)
* Submitted for & Accepted to - trainer at OWASP AppSec USA
* Completed my first 10 months at a new job
* Began and continuing Keto diet/lifestyle
