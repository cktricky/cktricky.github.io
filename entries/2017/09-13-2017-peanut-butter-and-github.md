# Peanut Butter and Github

This week I started at GitHub working on the security team. As part of our indoctrination to GitHub, we learn about the company's core values - chief amongst them, is empathy. This kind of reminded me of a recent situation since they are tangentially related. 

I had an interesting revelation and conversation recently. My son started Kindergarten a few weeks ago. We're learning the ropes as newcomers to the school system.

*2 - I'm not old, old. But I'm old enough for this to be a wtf for me upon initial reaction
*3 - After contemplation, I realized, I'm in the wrong... BUT!

BUT, for a moment I had a
