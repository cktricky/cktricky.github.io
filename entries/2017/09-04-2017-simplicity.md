# Simplicity

I wanted to focus on writing. I've purposfully omitted fancy features like social media shares and widgets from this site. I did not host on Medium or some other blogging platform because I hestitate to even call it a blog. More of a journal. This is just a spot for my thoughts as they come (and often go) and as such - opted for the most simple writing tool (for me). I chose a user page on GitHub, pointed my domain at GitHub's DNS, filled in the custom domain option on the GitHub project, selected a custom theme in the settings (minimal), and voila.

I look forward to writing again.
