# Simplicity

I wanted to focus on writing. I've purposfully omitted fancy features like social media shares and widgets from this site. I did not host on Medium or some other blogging platform because I hestitate to even call it a blog. More of a journal. This is just a spot for my thoughts as they come (and often go) and as such - opted for the most simple writing tool (for me).

I look forward to writing again.
